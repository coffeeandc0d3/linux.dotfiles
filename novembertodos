To X-forward a terminal over ssh: do `ssh pi@<ip address> -Y`, then on the Raspberry Pi type `lxterminal`. You also don't need to do this if you're okay with coding over the SSH PTY.

UEFI is short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface that offers users a faster, sleeker experience. But before we get too deep into UEFI, it's first important to understand what came before it: BIOS. Note: Newer PCs that already have UEFI might still call it the BIOS to avoid confusing consumers.

What helped for me (after above tips failed) was to re-enable booting up the Desktop GUI (raspi-config option S5). After rebooting once, WLAN came up fine. I once logged into the desktop to check everything, then used rapsi-config again to set it back to text console and after next reboot WLAN still worked.

The problem is that gnome-shell needs to be able to associate the window with the .desktop file. In applications that don't use the GtkApplication API (i.e. most non-GNOME applications) this is done by matching the WM_CLASS of the window with the corresponding .desktop file. So you either have to change the name of your .desktop file to match the WM_CLASS of the application windows or you have to specify a StartupWMClass key in your .desktop file that contains the WM_CLASS that should be matched to this .desktop file. You can find a window's WM_CLASS using xprop and then clicking on the window. It is the second entry in the list. Otherwise gnome-shell uses the icon specified by the window itself, which is probably the low resolution icon you are seeing.

<!!kind of hold your breathe with mouth open and feel it start> 
<try>dont think breathe in, think relax, bc when you pull from chest the diaphragm doesn't extend 

follow up by gasp or something, careful not to suck on inhale or blow on exhale   

Maybe try taking a smaller hit and building up your tolerance to larger hits. We all have to start somewhere. Alternatively, remember you are inhaling the air in the bong when you are filling it with smoke. That air is still there when you take your bong hit. What I like to do when I'm smoking larger bongs is to light up and fill the chamber. Then I exhale to get rid of the air in my lungs, before taking the hit. It's important to remember that part of why a bong is so potent is that you are creating a vacuum that forces the smoke in the lungs. So when you take the hit, you first need to recreate that vacuum before inhaling. Hope this helps

I had the same issue with my Maven pro tablet. It eventually got to the point i could barely hear it even with my ear next to speaker. I initially tried master reset but nothing changed. I removed the back and found that my speaker was a little dusty but had metal shavings beld magnetically all over the front of the speacker. wiped it clean with a soft dry towel and now they work like new again.
